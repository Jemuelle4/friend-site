          <p>Hello friend! I read your card early because I knew there were going to be some positive words and I really needed that. Thank you so much again for the scarf and the card! Unfortunately I wasn't able to give your gift to you when we met, nor do I have a physical card to give you... which is why I made this simple website! Our chat reminded me that I was gonna "make" a website for you, I've just forgotten. Also, yes you heard that right! I bought a gift for you and I didn't order it through Amazon; shopped locally! I don't know when I'll be able to give it to you though. Sometime soon hopefully!</p>

          <p>Much like you, our weekly chats have been keeping me sane. I don't usually hang out virtually with friends so I'm really glad we're doing these weekly chats! Someday we'll watch a series or movie again... when I'm less busy? Which I'm not really sure when that's going to be. Anyway, even if we don't watch anything together, I really enjoy just talking to you, whether that be just you telling me I should stop doing so many things, or me story-telling poorly, or you arguing that humans shouldn't explore new planets, or me talking about how much I hate LinkedIn, you get the idea.</p>

          <p>I cannot believe I'm gonna be working with you for the third time on a production. Thanks again for directing me in the past and the future! I should probably do stuff for my capstone so that you know what's happening... but really, you don't have to be involved until Spring quarter. Though mid-winter would be nice if I actually get stuff done lol.</p>

          <p>You know, I wanted this to be more interactive and have different sections, but I really have to work on other stuff like the redesigning the UTS website (I actually started Sunday after I submitted my essay (89/100). I also need to work on my own portfolio (but I can also make one for you, free of charge!). And finally apply for scholarships and internships. That's to say, WHY AM I SO BUSY EVEN WHEN I'M ON BREAK WTF. </p>


          <p>Oop, I'm getting off tangent there. I hope you have a merry christmas with your family and Carol(?) back at home. Please wish your mother (Lo) and your father (Salvador) a merry christmas for me (Did I get their names correctly?). ALSO please thank your mom for the cookies! They're really good and I wish I could bake something and give some to your family but I am no baker. Also, your parents were so welcoming when I visited and still very welcoming even after I left that I feel like they're my second family now. Oh, I could've gotten them a card at least.  </p>

          <p>Thank you for being such a great friend! For keeping me in check (yelling at me for writing on that one notebook, killing me (or something) if I become rich AND corrupt, etc). For being a winghuman (Never really gotten far with J but at least I tried lol). For being supportive of my studies (though flaunting you're no longer in college doesn't help, I will let it go because you TOTALLY EARNED IT! Flaunt it everyday, girl!!!). And for so many more you've done for me. You already know it, but I'm gonna say it anyway: I love you and I will always be here for you.</p>
